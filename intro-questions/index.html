                <li>Sasha Kostenko; Major in Communication Design, Minor in Computer Science; Junior</li><br>
                <li>I have a background in visual art, including a little animation and game development. 
                    I’ve also taken some computer science classes at WashU but had no real experience 
                    prior to that. I am taking this class as a requirement but hope that I can use it to 
                    strengthen my skills and push web dev as a form of artistic expression.</li><br>
                <li>I took Front-end Web Development last year, so I have one semester of HTML, CSS, and 
                    JS experience. I don’t have any back-end experience.</li><br>
                <li>I would like to grow more familiar with what makes successful website design. Additionally, 
                    I'd like to develop my skills in CSS and if possible dabble in Javascript.
                </li><br>
                <li>Designing for the screen requires a little more flexibility on the end of the design
                     – for example scaling for different screen sizes, for web and mobile, and interactivity. 
                     Screens are also inherently interactive and designed for the user to engage with them beyond
                      the visual senses!</li><br>
                <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>
                    <p>Pinterest's design exemplifies form following function. It's built to fill the most space 
                        possible with visual content, and is highly interactive allowing the site to hide all of its 
                        "extra" information like saving pins and personal boards behind a single click.
                    </p></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>
                    <p>The New York Times need to communicate a ton of information; considering their task of displaying a range of 
                        articles on different topics, I think they've been successful at avoiding flooding their readers with 
                        too much information. First, they've been able to stick with the newspaper aesthetic while mainting a degree 
                        of whitespace. They also offer a choice of different articles to read across the screen horizontally, but 
                        rarely show more than 2 or 3 in a row at a time (unless there is a section specifically for that). I think this 
                        avoids a totally overhwelming experience for the reader while still communicating plenty of information. And of course, 
                        the topics tabs at the top of the page allow further filtering and organization of what is shown.

                <li><a href="https://www.functionofbeauty.com/">Function of Beauty</a>
                    <p>I like Function of Beauty's website for how they've centered around clear actionables. 
                        Most of the information on the website is provided based on what customers have come to the
                         site for - for example, for haircare, there is one large button front and center on a page
                         full of whitespace telling customers to take a hair quiz, and so on for skin, various products, 
                         and so forth. For a brand specializing in customization, they work to tailor their site to their
                          customers' needs. They also have chosen and stuck with a pleasing color palette and have limited 
                          the amount of clutter across their site.
